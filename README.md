# hotlunch

This is a rewrite of software that I wrote for a catholic school in PHP.  I am porting it to python and rewritting it as a generic application to be able to be ported to any school / any lunch vendor.  As I am writing this for the parents at my sons school, I would like to make this available to others free of charge.
